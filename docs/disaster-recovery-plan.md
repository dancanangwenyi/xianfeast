# XianFeast Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the XianFeast Customer Ordering System, including backup strategies, recovery procedures, and business continuity measures.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

### Service Level Objectives
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours maximum downtime
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year)

### Priority Classification
1. **Critical**: Customer ordering system, authentication, payment processing
2. **High**: Order management, customer dashboard, business dashboards
3. **Medium**: Analytics, reporting, admin functions
4. **Low**: Documentation, logs, historical data

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backup Schedule
- **Daily Backups**: Every day at 2:00 AM (customer data, orders, recent changes)
- **Weekly Backups**: Every Sunday at 3:00 AM (full system backup)
- **Monthly Backups**: 1st day of month at 4:00 AM (complete archive)

### Backup Components
1. **Database Backups**
   - All DynamoDB tables (Users, Orders, Products, etc.)
   - Table schemas and indexes
   - Point-in-time recovery data

2. **Application Backups**
   - Configuration files (.env, next.config.js)
   - Application logs
   - Uploaded files and assets
   - SSL certificates

3. **Infrastructure Backups**
   - Server configurations
   - Load balancer settings
   - DNS configurations
   - Monitoring configurations

### Backup Storage
- **Primary**: Local backup storage (immediate access)
- **Secondary**: AWS S3 (encrypted, cross-region replication)
- **Tertiary**: Offline backup storage (monthly archives)

   - Update DNS and load balancer configurations
   - Implement temporary workarounds if needed

3. **Validation (240-300 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Identify recovery point
aws dynamodb describe-continuous-backups --table-name Orders

# 2. Restore to specific timestamp
aws dynamodb restore-table-to-point-in-time \
    --source-table-name Orders \
    --target-table-name Orders-Restored \
    --restore-date-time 2024-01-01T12:00:00Z

# 3. Validate and switch tables
npm run validate-table-data Orders-Restored
```

### Application Recovery

#### Quick Application Restart
```bash
