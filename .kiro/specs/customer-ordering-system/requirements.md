## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive customer ordering system for XianFeast that enables customers to sign up, authenticate via magic links, browse products, place orders, and manage their meal scheduling. The system will be fully integrated with DynamoDB and provide a production-grade experience with email notifications and order tracking.
