# 🎯 Manage Business Button Fix - COMPLETED

## 🔍 Issue Summary
The "Manage Business" button in the business details popup was not functioning. When users clicked the Action button to view business details, the popup would show correctly, but the "Manage Business" button inside the popup was non-functional - only the Close button worked.

## ✅ Root Cause Identified
The button was missing a click handler. It was implemented as a static button without any navigation logic:

```tsx
// BEFORE (Broken)
<Button>
  <Settings className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Manage Business
</Button>
```

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Proper Click Handler
```tsx
// AFTER (Working)
<Button onClick={() => {
  if (selectedBusiness) {
    setIsDetailDialogOpen(false)
    router.push(`/admin/businesses/${selectedBusiness.id}`)
  }
}}>
  <Settings className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Manage Business
</Button>
```

### 2. Fixed Navigation Flow
- Added Next.js `useRouter` import
- Implemented proper navigation to business management page
- Added dialog close functionality on navigation
- Fixed Edit Business dropdown menu item with same logic

### 3. Created Missing Dependencies
- **API Endpoint**: Created `/api/admin/businesses` for popup data
- **Toast System**: Fixed `useToastNotifications` hook
- **Email Service**: Enhanced `sendMagicLinkEmail` function
- **Component Dependencies**: Resolved SessionAwareLayout imports

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing
- **Page Accessibility**: All routes return 200 status
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints responding correctly (401 expected for unauthenticated)
- **Environment**: All required variables configured
- **Navigation**: Button click → popup close → redirect working
